## üéØ Project Summary

### Problem
Current polling-based monitoring creates unnecessary system load and has inherent latency, making it difficult to monitor multiple AI agents effectively in real-time.

### Solution
Implement a WebSocket-based real-time monitoring system that:
- Pushes events instantly to connected clients
- Reduces system load by eliminating polling
- Enables building of web dashboards and monitoring tools
- Supports multiple concurrent monitoring clients

### Key Features
- **Real-time event streaming** with <100ms latency
- **Subscription-based filtering** by event type, session, or window
- **Token-based authentication** with role-based permissions
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Event history buffer** for disconnection recovery
- **Client libraries** for Python and JavaScript

## üìä Technical Highlights

### Architecture
```
Clients ‚Üê WebSocket ‚Üí Server ‚Üê Events ‚Üê Tmux
         (Real-time)         (Polling)
```

### Performance Targets
- Event latency: <100ms
- Concurrent clients: 50+
- Memory usage: <50MB (10 clients)
- CPU usage: <5% normal operation
- Throughput: 1000+ events/second

### Security Features
- Token-based authentication
- Rate limiting per client
- Input validation
- Optional TLS encryption
- Audit logging

## üöÄ Implementation Timeline

### Sprint Overview (23 days total)
1. **Sprint 1** (Days 1-5): Core WebSocket infrastructure
2. **Sprint 2** (Days 6-10): Security & reliability
3. **Sprint 3** (Days 11-15): Client tools & libraries
4. **Sprint 4** (Days 16-20): Polish & performance
5. **Sprint 5** (Days 21-23): Deployment & monitoring

## üìù Usage Examples

### WebSocket Connection
```javascript
// Connect to WebSocket server
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8765/monitor');

// Authenticate
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  action: 'auth',
  token: 'your-token-here'
}));

// Subscribe to events
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  action: 'subscribe',
  filters: {
    types: ['agent.status', 'pane.output'],
    sessions: ['ai-chat']
  }
}));

// Receive events
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Event:', data.type, data.data);
};
```

### Python Client
```python
from tmux_websocket import TmuxMonitor

monitor = TmuxMonitor('ws://localhost:8765')
monitor.authenticate('your-token')
monitor.subscribe(types=['agent.status'])

for event in monitor.events():
    print(f"Event: {event.type} - {event.data}")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Migration Strategy

1. Deploy WebSocket server alongside existing system
2. No breaking changes to current monitoring
3. Gradual client migration
4. Deprecation timeline for polling
5. Complete transition in 3 months

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- Meet all performance requirements
- 99.9% uptime in first month
- Zero security incidents
- <5% CPU usage baseline

### Business Success
- 50% user adoption in 1 month
- 50% reduction in monitoring overhead
- 25% reduction in debugging time
- User satisfaction >4/5

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Planned for v2:
- Advanced filtering with queries
- Historical event replay
- Anomaly detection with ML
- External tool integrations
- Mobile app support
- Advanced visualization dashboard
