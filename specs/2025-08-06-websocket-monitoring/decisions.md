# Architectural Decision Records: WebSocket Real-Time Monitoring

## Decision 1: WebSocket Protocol for Real-Time Communication
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: The current Tmux Orchestrator uses polling-based monitoring which creates unnecessary load and has inherent latency. We need a real-time communication mechanism that can push updates to clients immediately.

**Decision**: Implement WebSocket protocol for bidirectional, real-time communication between the orchestrator and monitoring clients.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Real-time updates with minimal latency, reduced server load, bidirectional communication
- Negative: More complex than HTTP polling, requires persistent connections, needs reconnection handling
- Mitigation: Implement robust reconnection logic, provide fallback polling option

## Decision 2: AsyncIO-Based Implementation
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: WebSocket servers need to handle many concurrent connections efficiently. Traditional threading approaches would be resource-intensive for our use case.

**Decision**: Use Python's asyncio framework with the websockets library for the server implementation.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Efficient handling of concurrent connections, lower memory footprint, better scalability
- Negative: Requires Python 3.7+, asyncio learning curve, debugging complexity
- Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation, thorough testing, team training on asyncio

## Decision 3: Event-Driven Architecture
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: The system needs to react to various tmux state changes and distribute them to interested clients efficiently.

**Decision**: Implement an event-driven architecture with event types, subscriptions, and filters.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Loose coupling, scalable design, flexible filtering, easy to extend
- Negative: Additional complexity, potential for event storms, debugging challenges
- Mitigation: Rate limiting, event batching, comprehensive logging

---

## Decision 4: Token-Based Authentication
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: WebSocket connections need to be authenticated to prevent unauthorized access to orchestrator data and control.

**Decision**: Use token-based authentication with the first WebSocket message containing an authentication token.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Stateless authentication, simple to implement, works with existing auth systems
- Negative: Token management overhead, need secure token storage
- Mitigation: Token expiration, secure token generation, optional TLS encryption

---

## Decision 5: JSON Message Protocol
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: We need a structured format for WebSocket messages that's easy to parse and extend.

**Decision**: Use JSON for all WebSocket messages with a defined schema for each message type.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Human-readable, wide language support, easy to debug, extensible
- Negative: Larger message size than binary protocols, parsing overhead
- Mitigation: Message compression option, efficient JSON libraries, batching small messages

---

## Decision 6: Hybrid Polling-Push Model
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: We need to detect tmux state changes to generate events, but tmux doesn't provide native event hooks.

**Decision**: Use efficient polling of tmux state to detect changes, then push events via WebSocket.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Works with existing tmux, no tmux modifications needed, reliable change detection
- Negative: Still requires some polling, potential for missed rapid changes
- Mitigation: Optimized batch queries, configurable poll rates, state diffing

---

## Decision 7: Client Library Strategy
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Clients need easy ways to connect to the WebSocket server without implementing the protocol details.

**Decision**: Provide official client libraries for Python and JavaScript, with a simple, consistent API.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Easy adoption, consistent implementation, reduced client-side bugs
- Negative: Maintenance burden, need to support multiple languages
- Mitigation: Keep libraries minimal, extensive examples, community contributions

---

## Decision 8: Gradual Migration Path
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: The existing polling-based system is in production use and cannot be immediately replaced.

**Decision**: Deploy WebSocket monitoring alongside existing system with a gradual migration path.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: No breaking changes, time for testing, gradual adoption
- Negative: Temporary code duplication, need to maintain both systems
- Mitigation: Clear deprecation timeline, feature flags, migration documentation

---

## Decision 9: Rate Limiting Per Client
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Malicious or misbehaving clients could overwhelm the server with requests or subscriptions.

**Decision**: Implement per-client rate limiting using a token bucket algorithm.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Protection against abuse, fair resource allocation, predictable performance
- Negative: Additional complexity, legitimate burst traffic might be limited
- Mitigation: Configurable limits, burst allowance, monitoring of limit hits

---

## Decision 10: No External Dependencies for Core
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: We want to maintain the orchestrator's minimal dependency footprint while adding WebSocket support.

**Decision**: Use only Python standard library plus the minimal websockets library for core functionality.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Easy installation, fewer security concerns, simpler deployment
- Negative: Can't use specialized libraries, more custom code
- Mitigation: Optional dependencies for advanced features, clear documentation

---

## Decision 11: Event History Buffer
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Clients may disconnect temporarily and miss events, or may want to see recent history when connecting.

**Decision**: Maintain a limited event history buffer (last 1000 events or 5 minutes) in memory.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Clients can catch up after disconnection, useful for debugging
- Negative: Memory usage, complexity in managing buffer
- Mitigation: Configurable buffer size, automatic cleanup, optional persistence

---

## Decision 12: Localhost-Only by Default
**Date**: 2025-08-06
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Security is a concern when exposing orchestrator data over the network.

**Decision**: Bind to localhost only by default, require explicit configuration for network access.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: Secure by default, prevents accidental exposure
- Negative: Additional configuration for remote monitoring
- Mitigation: Clear documentation for network setup, TLS configuration guide

## Future Considerations

### Potential Decision: WebSocket Compression
**Status**: Under Consideration

**Context**: Large volumes of events could consume significant bandwidth.

**Considerations**:
- Per-message compression available in WebSocket
- Trade-off between CPU usage and bandwidth
- May not be beneficial for small messages

### Potential Decision: Redis for Event Queue
**Status**: Under Consideration

**Context**: For high-availability deployments, events might need persistence.

**Considerations**:
- Redis could provide persistent event queue
- Enables multiple orchestrator instances
- Adds external dependency

### Potential Decision: GraphQL Subscriptions
**Status**: Under Consideration

**Context**: More complex filtering and queries might be needed.

**Considerations**:
- GraphQL provides rich query language
- Better for complex data requirements
- Significant additional complexity

### Potential Decision: Binary Protocol (MessagePack)
**Status**: Under Consideration

**Context**: JSON overhead might become significant at scale.

**Considerations**:
- MessagePack is more efficient than JSON
- Still schema-flexible
- Less human-readable for debugging
